## Static vs Dynamic Allocation 

Dynamic Memory Allocation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows you to allocate memory 
for objects at runtime, rather than at compile-time. In C++, this is particularly important 
when you don't know the size or number of objects you need to create ahead of time. 
C++ provides operators such as new and delete to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically 
for objects. 

Key Concepts: 
new Operator: Allocates memory for an object or array of objects during runtime and returns a 
pointer to the newly allocated memory. 

delete Operator: Deallocates memory that was previously allocated by new to avoid memory 
leaks. 


```c++
// Basic Example of Dynamic Memory Allocation for an Object: 
 
#include <iostream> 
class Car { 
public: 
    int speed; 
	// Constructor 
    Car(int s) : speed(s) { 
        std::cout << "Car created with speed: " << speed << std::endl; 
	} 
	// Destructor 
    ~Car() { 
        std::cout << "Car with speed " << speed << " is being destroyed." << std::endl; 
	} 
}; 
int main() { 
	// Dynamically allocate memory for an object of type Car 
	Car* myCar = new Car(120);  // 'new' allocates memory dynamically for the object 
	// Accessing the object 
    std::cout << "Car speed: " << myCar->speed << std::endl; 
	// Deallocating memory 
    delete myCar;  // 'delete' frees the memory 
    return 0; 
} 
 
// Output: 
// Car created with speed: 120 
// Car speed: 120 
// Car with speed 120 is being destroyed.
```

#### How It Works: 

Car* myCar = new Car(120);: This line dynamically allocates memory for an object of type Car  
and initializes it with the constructor (Car(120)). It returns a pointer myCar to the  
allocated memory.  

delete myCar;: This releases the memory occupied by the object. Failing to call delete after dynamic memory allocation leads to memory leaks.   


```c++
// Dynamic Memory Allocation for an Array of Objects: 
// You can also dynamically allocate memory for an array of objects using new[] and 
// deallocate it with delete[] 
 
#include <iostream> 
class Car { 
public: 
    int speed; 
	// Constructor 
    Car(int s) : speed(s) { 
        std::cout << "Car created with speed: " << speed << std::endl; 
	} 
	// Destructor 
    ~Car() { 
        std::cout << "Car with speed " << speed << " is being destroyed." << std::endl; 
	} 
}; 
int main() { 
	// Dynamically allocating an array of Car objects 
	Car* cars = new Car[3] { {100}, {120}, {140} };  // Using an initializer list 
	// Accessing the objects 
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) { 
        std::cout << "Car " << i+1 << " speed: " << cars[i].speed << std::endl; 
	} 
	// Deallocating the array of objects 
    delete[] cars;  // Using delete[] to free array memory 
    return 0; 
} 
 
// Output: 
// Car created with speed: 100 
// Car created with speed: 120 
// Car created with speed: 140 
// Car 1 speed: 100 
// Car 2 speed: 120 
// Car 3 speed: 140 
// Car with speed 100 is being destroyed. 
// Car with speed 120 is being destroyed. 
// Car with speed 140 is being destroyed. 
// Explanation: 
// new[]: Allocates memory for an array of objects and calls the constructor for each object. 
// delete[]: Deallocates the memory for the array of objects and calls the destructor for each object in the array. 


// @Memory Leaks: 
// If you fail to use delete or delete[] to deallocate memory allocated with new or new[], you 
// end up with memory leaksâ€”memory that is no longer used by the program but hasn't been 
// returned to the system 

// @Advantages of Dynamic Memory Allocation in OOP: 
// Flexibility: You can allocate memory at runtime based on actual needs. 
// Efficiency: You only use the amount of memory required at a specific time, reducing wastage. 

// Handling Large Objects: Allows for the creation of large arrays or objects that cannot fit 
// into the stack (local memory). 
```
